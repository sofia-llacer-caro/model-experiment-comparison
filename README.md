# Comparison between modelled and experimental data for the flux of fluorine cosmic rays 
This is a project I worked on during the third year of my Physics BSc for the course Astroparticle Physics. The aim of the assignment was to compare experimental data to data obtained from computational models in which different parameters of the simulation were varied. The data for the flux of fluorine cosmic rays was obtained through the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer collaboration (AMS). For more information on both the experimental data and the model used for the simulation, please refer to the final report available on the repository.
