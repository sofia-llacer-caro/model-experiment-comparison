# Comparison between modelled and experimental data for the flux of fluorine cosmic rays 
This is a project developed for the course Astroparticle Physics at the University of Groningen. The aim of the assignment was to compare experimental data to data obtained from computational models in which different parameters of the simulation were varied. The data for the flux of fluorine cosmic rays was obtained through the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer collaboration (AMS). For more information on both the experimental data and the model used for the simulation, please refer to the final report available on the repository.

## The general idea
The code developed for this project was based on the need to compare real-world data to the models created by us to understanded. Even though the work is Physics-based, the ideas behind it can be applied to any other area of knowledge though the simple question: How much does my theory differ from the actual data?

## The implementation
In order to answer this question, a 3-step approach was followed:
1. Data retrieval
2. Data analysis
3. Data visualization
